        <p>One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat over their winter fire in the little
            French town of Annonay, watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their
            names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and were noted as possessing
            thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery. Before that night—a
            memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of
            their fires without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.</p>
